<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>In the heart of Gotham, where shadows dance with the echoes of crime and corruption, I emerge as a symbol of justice and retribution. By day, I am Bruce Wayne, a billionaire philanthropist
   and the last scion of the Wayne family. My public persona is one of luxury and privilege, a mask to hide the true mission that defines my existence. But when the sun sets and the city
    succumbs to its darker impulses, I become the Batman, a relentless guardian who prowls the night, ever vigilant in my quest to protect the innocent and bring evildoers to justice.</p>

<p>My journey began in tragedy. As a child, I witnessed the brutal murder of my parents,
   Thomas and Martha Wayne, in a cold, dark alley. That moment of horror and loss forged
    a path of vengeance and determination within me. I dedicated my life to mastering the skills necessary
     to combat the evil that took my family away. Trained in the arts of combat, detective work,
      and stealth by the greatest masters around the world, I honed my body and mind into the ultimate weapon against crime.
       My intellect is my greatest ally, coupled with an arsenal of high-tech gadgets and vehicles,
   all designed to give me the edge over Gotham's most dangerous adversaries.</p>
